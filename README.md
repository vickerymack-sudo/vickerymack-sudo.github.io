# Flight Incident Simulator

A text-based flight simulator game focused on accident chains and emergency decision-making.

## Scenario style
The game models escalating incidents such as:
- Engine smoke
- Engine fire
- Cabin smoke
- Emergency diversion and landing

At each stage, the player chooses an action. Correct actions improve safety and score, while poor choices worsen conditions and can end the flight.

## Run
```bash
python3 flight_simulator.py
```

## Goal
Handle the emergency, keep control of the aircraft, and land safely.
